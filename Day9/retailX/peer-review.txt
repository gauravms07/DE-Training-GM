Problem Understanding -	Clearly grasps the goal of tracking historical changes in a customer dimension table using SCD Type-2 logic. Good articulation of real-world use cases.

Data Setup - Source and existing dimension DataFrames are created with explicit schema definitions, which is good practice to avoid Spark type inference issues.

Change Detection Logic - Logic is implemented using a left join and comparison of non-key attributes (Address, LoyaltyTier). This is correct and aligns with standard SCD2 detection methods.

New vs Changed vs Unchanged	Clearly differentiates between new, changed, and unchanged records. The logic for each case is correctly applied and easy to follow.

SCD Columns Handling - Proper use of StartDate, EndDate, and IsCurrent. Expired records are updated correctly, and new versions are added with appropriate defaults.

Surrogate Key Strategy - Uses monotonically_increasing_id() for surrogate keys. While acceptable for demo, in production this is non-deterministic and should be replaced with a UUID or sequence generator.

Code Modularity - The logic is currently written as a monolithic script. Modularizing into reusable functions (e.g., detectChanges(), applySCD2()) would increase reusability and readability.

Assumptions & Edge Cases - Assumes CustomerID is unique in both source and target datasets. No deduplication or null handling was applied, which could be added for robustness.

Output Handling	- Final merged DataFrame is printed but not written to storage (e.g., Delta table). A .write.format("delta")... step would complete the pipeline.

Scalability - Works well for a batch demo. For large datasets or streaming contexts, performance tuning (e.g., broadcast joins, caching) and fault tolerance (checkpointing) will be needed.

Documentation - Code is understandable but lacks inline comments and logging. Adding those would help others follow the transformations step-by-step.

Reusability & Configurability - Parameters like primary key, tracked fields, and output path are hardcoded. Extracting these into configs or arguments would make the script reusable across dimension tables.
